   information of Side Effects Software such as trade secrets, business or
   product plans, which might be disclosed during the course of the software
   testing (the "Confidential Information").
4. Side Effects Software wishes to ensure that the Software & Materials are not
   used by Beta Tester for purposes other than alpha/beta testing and that they

    prior to the date hereof and was not acquired directly or indirectly from

    information directly or indirectly from Side Effects Software.
3. Beta Tester shall not communicate or otherwise disclose to Side Effects
